# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository showcases my work and projects in **Data Analytics**. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:

- Collect, clean, and organize data from various sources  
- Perform exploratory data analysis and generate insights  
- Visualize data using tools like Power BI, Excel, and Python  
- Document findings and present actionable recommendations  

Each project in this portfolio focuses on real-world scenarios where I applied analytical and problem-solving skills to extract insights and support data-driven decision-making. The projects highlight my readiness for entry-level Data Analyst roles.
