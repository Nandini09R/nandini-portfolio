# Business System Analyst Portfolio

This repository showcases my work and projects as a **Business System Analyst (BSA)**. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:  

- Analyze business processes and identify bottlenecks  
- Design optimized workflows and process improvements  
- Document requirements, solutions, and expected outcomes  
- Use tools like flowcharts, diagrams, and BRDs to communicate effectively  

Each project in this portfolio focuses on real-world scenarios where I applied analytical and problem-solving skills to improve business operations. The projects include process analysis, workflow optimization, and documentation that highlight my readiness for entry-level BSA roles.
